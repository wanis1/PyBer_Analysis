# PYBER ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
The first part of this analysis is based on creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Pandas. The second part of the analysis is creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## RESULTS
### Ride-Sharing Data by City Type:
In this part of the analysis, we used groupby(), count() and sum() functions to calculatee the total number of rides, total number of drivers, the total fares, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver for each city type. The summary is shared in the dataframe image below:

According to this analysis:
- The highest number of rides, the highest number of drivers and the highest amount of total fare generated is in the Urban city type, followed by Suburband and Rural.
- The highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver is in the Rural city type, followed by Suburban and Urban city types.
- The number of drivers for urban type is higher than the total number of rides, whereas for rural and suburban types the number of rides is higher than the number of drivers available.

### Total Fares for Each City Type:
In this ppart of analysis, we created a multiple line chart reflecting total fares generated by each city type for each week between 01-01-2019 and 04-29-2019. The line chart is given below:

- According to this graph, the highest fare generated throughtout the four months is for urban city ctype followed by suburban and rural.
- The highest amount of fare for urban and suburban city types was in the last week of February. For rural type, the last week of February did generate a higher amount of fare compared to most other weeks, but the highest fare was collected in the last week of March.

## SUMMARY
Since, the avaerage fare per driver in rural and suburban areas is higher than urban areas, some of the drivers should be moved from urban to rural and suburban areas to meet the high demand there. This would decrease the total number of drivers in urban areas hence increaseing the average fare per driver, thus addressing the disparities between average fares between all three regions. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride is much higher than Suburban and urban cities. This can indicate that drivers in rural areas possibly take longer trips in general.
